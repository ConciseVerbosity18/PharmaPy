State events
============

State events are passed as Python dictionaries. Simple state events based directly on model states (i.e. :math:`f(y) = y`) can be passed as shown for the following structure. For detecting a given temperature, one would do:

.. testcode::

   my_state_event = {'state_name': 'temperature', 'value': 400} 

If a given state is index, e.g. concentration for a given component, the dictionary also needs to have the `state_idx` field. For example, for detecting the concentration the firs component for a reactor model, the dictinary to be passed would be:

.. testcode::

   my_state_event = {'state_name': 'mole_conc', 'state_idx': 0, 'value': 0.2} 

Interpolators
===============

Input trajectories can be specified via interpolators. To this purpose, PharmaPy contains a Lagrange polynomial represention that describes a time-dependent input :math:`u(t)` as:

.. math::

   u(t) = \sum_{i = 1}^{ord} u_{i, k} \ell_i^{(ord)} (\tau^{(k)}), \quad t \in [t_{k - 1}, t_k], \ k \in \{1, \ldots, n_{interv}\},

for a set of user-provided points :math:`u_{i, k}, \ i \in \{1, \ldots, ord\}` within the interval :math:`k`.  :math:`\tau` is a normalized time variable given by:

.. math::
   \tau = \frac{t - t_{k - 1}}{t_{k} - t_{k - 1}}, \quad t \in [t_{k - 1}, t_k]

and :math:`\ell^{(ord)}` are Lagrange interpolation polynomials given by:

.. math::
   \ell_{i}^{(ord)} =
   \begin{cases}
       1, & ord = 1, \\
       \prod_{j = 1, j \neq i}^{ord} \frac{\tau - \tau_j}{\tau_i - \tau_j}  & ord \geq 2,
   \end{cases}

where :math:`ord` represents the order of the interpolation (1 for piecewise constant, 2 for piecewise linear, etc).

In practical terms, a PharmaPy lagrange interpolator can be created as:
