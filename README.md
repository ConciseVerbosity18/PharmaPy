# PharmaPy

PharmaPy is a pythonic library for the analysis of pharmaceutical manufacturing systems. It allows to simulate the dynamics of standalone, drug substance unit operations in a variety of operating modes (batch, continuous, semibatch). Also, PharmaPy facilitaes setting up and simulating pharmaceutical **flowsheets**, i.e., interconnected unit operations in a variety of operation modes, ranging from end-to-end batch, end-to-end continuous, and hybrid operation (combination of batch and/or continuous and semicontinuous unit operations).
