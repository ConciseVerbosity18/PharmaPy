Step 1: Create a conda environment named <env_name> (optional)

conda create --name <env_name> python=3.7

Step 1.1: If making a virtual environment

conda activate <env_name>

This activates the environment. You may deactivate the environment using
the command:

conda deactivate

All the packages installed will be frozen on this environment, and will be
separate from those installed on your base environment. Using this virtual
environment structure allows us to have only the packages we need to do
the analysis we need to do! If you want to use base, you may continue to step
2 without doing steps 1 and 1.1.

Step 2: Install the package requirements in requirements.txt

conda install -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt

Step 3: Install PharmaPy; navigate to the source directory

python setup.py develop

Step 4: Check to see if the package is working by running a test in tests/
